### <mark style="color:purple;">DUTIES:</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;">**Identifying Prospects:**</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">Utilize your networking skills and industry knowledge to identify potential project developers interested in launching their projects with RogerPad.</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;">**Engagement and Convincing:**</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">Engage with these developers, highlighting the benefits and use cases of launching with RogerPad. Showcase your vast knowledge of the platform and its capabilities to persuade them to choose RogerPad for their project launch.</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;">**Facilitating Communication:**</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">**Once you've piqued a developer's interest, facilitate communication by creating a Telegram group with the CEO (@rogerpad\_ceo) and inviting the prospect**</mark><mark style="color:purple;">. The CEO and other team members will then address the developer's questions or concerns.</mark>

### <mark style="color:purple;">REWARDS:</mark>

You can earn in two ways.

#### **Responsibilities:**&#x20;

Actively assist the project, prominently displaying the SM (Sales Manager) tag in our social media profiles, and being listed on the [Gitbook](verified-listing-managers.md) for prospects to verify. _You must also change your bio and profile picture on all social media platforms to reflect your affiliation with Roger._

1\.      <mark style="color:purple;">RECEIVE 20% OF POOL CREATION CHARGES</mark>

2\.     RECEIVE 1%  OF THE SUCCESSFUL POOL RAISE

#### REWARDS CALCULATIONS

**Commission Calculation:** We have changed our way of paying out to our sales managers after consulting with several of our advisors.

One of the issues with the Crypto space, rewards are always based on the finalized successful raises only.  All the work and time are wasted if the pool gets canceled.

So we are changing it.  You will receive 20% of the Pool Creation Fee and 1% of the Raised Succesful Sale.

Commission Payout: Upon finalization of a successful raise launch, commission payments will be sent individually to the designated wallet within 48 hours. Ensure you are registered and part of the appropriate group as assigned for seamless communication and payment processing.

With your dedication and expertise, you play a pivotal role in driving the growth and success of projects launched through RogerPad.

### <mark style="color:green;">Example of Commission:</mark>

<mark style="color:green;">Sales Manager I</mark>

**A successful project that raised 500 SOL.**

Pool Creation charge for this project: 4 SOL

Reward from Pool Creation fee:  4 x 20% = .8 sol

Raised Sale 500 SOL |      500 x 1%   = 5 SOL

<mark style="color:green;">**Your total reward for this pool: 5.8 SOL**</mark>
