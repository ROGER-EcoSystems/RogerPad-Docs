## Two Classifications

1. **Verified and Endorsed Marketers**: These marketers have passed our rigorous vetting process and are highly recommended for their proven expertise and effectiveness.
2. **Listed Marketers**: These call partners are either in the process of verification or have not yet been verified. We do not endorse them, so please conduct your own research (DYOR) before hiring.

## Verified Marketers

At RogerPad, we employ rigorous methods to ensure our marketers are among the best in the industry. Our selection process includes comprehensive vetting, performance evaluations, and ongoing training to maintain the highest standards of quality and effectiveness.

However, the success of your project also depends significantly on its inherent value and the engagement of its target audience. While our verified marketers can provide exceptional support, it is crucial for you to conduct your own research (DYOR) and make informed decisions.

These callers have done a tremendous job supporting our launchpad, and we highly recommend utilizing their services. For more detailed information on our selection criteria and the methods we use to verify our marketers, please refer to the upcoming pages. This will provide you with a deeper understanding of our processes and how we ensure the excellence of our marketing team.



### Listed Marketers



We have included a diverse array of call partners on our platform. While these marketers have been around us and are either in the process of being verified or have not yet achieved verified status, we do not officially endorse or recommend them. We encourage you to conduct your own research (DYOR) before hiring any of these listed marketers to ensure they meet your project's specific needs and standards.
