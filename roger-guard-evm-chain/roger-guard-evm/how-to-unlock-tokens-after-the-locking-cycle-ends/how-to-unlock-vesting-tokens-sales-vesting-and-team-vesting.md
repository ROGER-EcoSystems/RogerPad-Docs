# How to Unlock Vesting Tokens (Sales Vesting and Team Vesting)

1\.      After the completion of each vesting cycle, project owners can unlock their vested tokens by visiting the RogerGuard page and clicking the “Unlock” button.

2\.     If project owners are unable to withdraw their vested tokens immediately after a cycle expires, they can do so at any later time. In such cases, the amount available for withdrawal will include the balance from the previous cycle, along with the tokens from the most recently expired cycle. This ensures flexibility in unlocking tokens as needed.
