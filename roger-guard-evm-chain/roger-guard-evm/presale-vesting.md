# PreSale Vesting

In cryptocurrency, vesting lock refers to a mechanism where tokens are locked and released gradually over a specific period. This is often used to ensure the long-term commitment of project team members, early investors, or other stakeholders. Vesting schedules help prevent sudden large sell-offs of tokens (also called "token dumps") that could harm the project or its token value.
