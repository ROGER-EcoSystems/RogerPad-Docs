# Renounce Lock Ownership

To renounce ownership of a lock, select the "Renounce Lock Ownership" option. This action permanently transfers ownership to a dead wallet, effectively preventing any future interaction, unlocking, or removal of the locked liquidity/tokens once the lock period ends.

It is crucial to fully understand the implications of renouncing ownership before proceeding, as this action is irreversible. RogerPad assumes no liability for any losses incurred as a result of renouncing ownership or any related actions or inactions.
