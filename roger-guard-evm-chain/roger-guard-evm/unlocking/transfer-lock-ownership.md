# Transfer Lock Ownership

The Transfer Lock Ownership feature on RogerGuard allows project owners to transfer ownership of a token lock to another wallet. This ensures that the new owner gains full control over the locked tokens or liquidity for the remainder of the lock period.

How to Transfer Lock Ownership

1. Access the Token Lock: Navigate to the RogerGuard page, and select the specific token lock you wish to transfer from the list.
2. Connect the Current Owner’s Wallet: Ensure the wallet of the current owner is connected to RogerGuard.
3. Initiate the Transfer: Click on the “Transfer Lock Ownership” button to begin the process.
4. Put your new owner address and click “confirm,”
5. Confirm the Transaction: MetaMask will prompt you to confirm the transaction and display the associated network fee. Carefully review the details of the transaction. If everything is accurate, click “Confirm” to finalize the transfer.

Important Notes

* Once the transfer is complete, the wallet designated as the new owner will have full ownership of the lock. This includes all rights to interact with the lock, such as unlocking or modifying it when permitted.
