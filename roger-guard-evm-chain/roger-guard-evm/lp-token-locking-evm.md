# LP/Token Locking \[evm]

Roger Pad provides project launches with two distinct options for liquidity pool (LP) creation, catering to diverse project needs and preferences. These options offer varying levels of automation and control, allowing project owners to select the most suitable approach for their specific requirements. This summary provides an overview of Roger Pad's LP creation options, highlighting their features and considerations.

> Please note: For the protection of our investors, Manual LP is permitted only during the Private Sale and Seed Phase Sale. All other sale pools must have Auto LP enabled, with a minimum of 51% of the raised funds allocated to LP. Exceptions to the 51% requirement may be made for projects that incorporate a buyback and burn program, with the combined total (LP and buyback/burn) reaching 51% or more to qualify.

#### Automatic LP Creation: <a href="#automatic-lp-creation" id="automatic-lp-creation"></a>

Roger Pad's automatic LP creation option streamlines the process of establishing liquidity pools for project launches. Integrated with efficient algorithms and platforms like Raydium DEX, this automated approach simplifies setup and management tasks, enhancing liquidity provision efficiency and supporting smoother trading experiences. However, project owners should consider potential additional fees and compatibility with different presale types when opting for automatic LP creation.

#### Manual LP Creation: <a href="#manual-lp-creation" id="manual-lp-creation"></a>

Alternatively, Roger Pad offers a manual LP creation option that empowers project owners with greater control and customization capabilities. With this approach, project owners have the flexibility to tailor liquidity pool parameters to specific project requirements and market conditions. While providing enhanced control and customization options, manual LP creation typically requires more time and effort to set up and manage compared to automated methods. Project owners should carefully evaluate trade-offs, considering factors such as budget constraints and presale type compatibility when selecting manual LP creation for their project launch on Roger Pad.
