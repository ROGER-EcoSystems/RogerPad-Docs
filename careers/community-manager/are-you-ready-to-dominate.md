# Are you ready to Dominate?

#### Are you ready to dominate? The Roger Eco System is seeking highly driven, results-oriented individuals to join our exclusive team as Business Development Managers (BDMs). This is not just a job—it’s a lifestyle. You will be the face of the Roger Eco System, spearheading the expansion of our projects, sealing strategic partnerships, and being recognized as a key influencer in our growing ecosystem.

## Why You? Why Now?

Roger Eco System is exploding with opportunities, and we need leaders who can take full ownership of a portfolio, drive engagement, and secure wins. As a BDM, you will be on the frontlines, commanding attention, building alliances, and pushing the Roger mission forward at full throttle.

## What Does It Take?

This isn’t a role for the half-hearted. We demand 100% loyalty to the Roger Eco System. If you can’t give your all, don’t bother applying.

* Total Dedication: You must be 100% committed to the Roger Eco System. There’s no room for divided attention—you’ll represent only Roger. No side projects, no distractions. We will put you front and center on our website and GitBook, which means every move you make will be under the spotlight.
* Social Media Warrior: You will own social media. Your accounts will be dedicated solely to Roger Eco System projects. Every post, every interaction, every PFP—it’s all Roger, all the time.
* Exclusive Representation: We can’t afford to have you dabbling in other projects. Once you become a BDM, you’re locked in. Full stop. You’ll carry the official BDM tag and be recognized as a trusted, elite representative of our ecosystem.

## Your Mission:

* Specialized Portfolio Domination: You will be assigned to specific Roger portfolios, and you will own them. Become the expert. Outshine the competition. Push boundaries.
* Aggressive Partnership Development: We don’t play the waiting game. You will hunt down opportunities—and you will close them. You will build partnerships that propel the Roger Eco System forward at breakneck speed.
* 24/7 Brand Advocacy: This is not a 9-5 gig. You will live and breathe Roger. You will be the loudest voice in the room, the strongest advocate for our ecosystem. Your bio, PFP, and everything you stand for online will scream Roger.

What’s in It for You?

* Unmatched Recognition: You’ll be publicly recognized across all Roger platforms. Your name, face, and achievements will be featured for the entire community to see. This is your chance to shine and cement your place in the future of blockchain.
* Influence and Power: You’re not just part of the team—you’re a leader. Your decisions will impact the direction of the Roger Eco System, and your success will define your role in the crypto space.
* Exclusivity: This is a rare opportunity to be one of the elite few who will help us conquer the market.
