# Dex Listing Rate

### PreSale Launch

To determine how many tokens you'll receive for 1 BNB on a decentralized exchange (DEX), you'll need to know the token's price in terms of SOL and any associated fees. Once you have this information, you can calculate the number of tokens using the following formula:

Number of Tokens = Amount of SOL / Price of Token

For example, if the token you're buying is priced at 0.1 SOL per token and there are no fees, then you'll receive 10 tokens for 1 SOL (1 BNB / 0.1 BNB per token = 10 tokens).

However, please note that transaction fees and slippage may affect the actual number of tokens you receive. Always double-check the exchange interface for the latest price and ensure you're comfortable with any associated fees before making a trade.

{% hint style="danger" %}
In a fair launch raise, the DEX listing rate is typically entered as a percentage, representing the portion of the total tokens allocated for liquidity provision on the decentralized exchange (DEX). However, the actual DEX listing rate will be determined only after the presale pool is finalized. This means that the percentage entered during the presale is used as a placeholder, and the final rate will be calculated based on the total amount raised and the number of tokens allocated for liquidity provision. Therefore, participants will know the exact DEX listing rate only after the presale concludes and the final allocation details are determined.
