# Presale Rate

### PreSale Launch

To determine how many tokens you'll receive for 1 SOL during the presale, you'll need to know the token price in terms of SOL. If the token price is, for example, 0.01 SOL per token, then you'll receive 100 tokens for 1 SOL (1 SOL / 0.01 SOL per token = 100 tokens). However, without knowing the specific token price, I cannot provide an exact answer.

{% hint style="danger" %}
In fair launches, the exact number of tokens you'll receive for 1 SOL won't be known until the presale pool ends. This is because the token price is determined based on the total amount raised and the number of tokens available in the pool. Once the presale concludes, the tokens will be distributed proportionally to participants based on their contribution amount relative to the total raised. Therefore, the number of tokens you'll receive for 1 SOL will depend on the final token price determined at the end of the presale.
