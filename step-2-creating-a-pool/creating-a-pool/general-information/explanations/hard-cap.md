# Hard Cap

The hard cap represents the maximum amount of funds that a project aims to raise during its fundraising campaign. It serves as an upper limit or ceiling on the total fundraising goal. The hard cap is typically determined based on the project's funding requirements, development costs, and scalability considerations.

Setting a hard cap is essential for providing clarity to investors and stakeholders about the project's fundraising goals and limitations. It helps manage expectations and ensures that the project does not raise more funds than it needs to achieve its objectives. Additionally, the hard cap helps maintain transparency and accountability throughout the fundraising process.

Exceeding the hard cap can lead to challenges such as overcapitalization, dilution of token value, and regulatory concerns. Therefore, it's crucial for projects to carefully consider and set an appropriate hard cap that aligns with their funding needs and long-term objectives.

Overall, the hard cap serves as a critical parameter in structuring a fundraising campaign, guiding investors, and safeguarding the project's financial sustainability and integrity.
