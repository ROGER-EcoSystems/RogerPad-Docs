<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/TRENDING.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

RogerPad offers two trending promotional services on their platform: Organic Promotions and Paid Promotions. These services are designed to help users maximize their reach and impact within the RogerPad ecosystem.

* [**Organic Promotion**](https://docs.rogerpad.finance/devleopers-corner/trending-services/organic-trending)**s** focus on leveraging natural, non-paid methods to increase visibility and engagement. This can include community-driven initiatives, user-generated content, and strategic partnerships that organically build the RogerPad brand and its projects.
* [**Paid Promotions**](https://docs.rogerpad.finance/devleopers-corner/trending-services/paid-trending) involve direct investment in advertising and marketing efforts to enhance visibility and attract potential investors or users. This can include targeted campaigns, sponsored content, and other forms of paid media designed to quickly amplify the reach and effectiveness of promotional efforts.

Both services provide unique opportunities for users and developers within the RogerPad ecosystem to grow their projects and reach broader audiences.
