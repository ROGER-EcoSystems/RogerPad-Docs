#### [PUBLIC SALE](https://docs.rogerpad.finance/devleopers-corner/presale-models/public-sale) <a href="#public-sale" id="public-sale"></a>

Experience inclusivity and transparency in token distribution with a Public Sale, where investors of all backgrounds have equal access to project tokens. This open approach fosters trust and broad adoption, empowering everyone to contribute to the project's success.&#x20;

* In a Public Sale, also known as an Open Sale, tokens are available to a wide range of investors without restrictions. This type of sale allows anyone interested in the project to participate, providing equal opportunity for all to acquire tokens. Public sales are characterized by their inclusivity and accessibility, making them an attractive option for projects seeking broad exposure and widespread adoption. Additionally, the transparency of public sales fosters trust among investors, as everyone has the same chance to participate and contribute to the project's success.

#### [WHITELIST SALE](https://docs.rogerpad.finance/devleopers-corner/presale-models/whitelist) <a href="#whitelist-sale" id="whitelist-sale"></a>

Join a select group of approved participants in a Whitelist Sale, where priority access is granted to early supporters, community members, and strategic partners. This exclusive opportunity not only rewards loyalty but also builds anticipation and momentum ahead of the token launch.

* Only wallets included in your whitelist can participate in the presale during the whitelist period. This option provides exclusivity and ensures that only selected investors can buy during the initial sale. In a Whitelist Sale, participation is restricted to a predetermined list of approved addresses. These addresses are typically selected based on criteria set by the project team, such as early supporters, community members, or strategic partners. Whitelisted participants are given priority access to the token sale, ensuring that they have the opportunity to contribute before the sale opens to the general public. This type of sale is often used to reward loyal community members or to comply with regulatory requirements in certain jurisdictions. Whitelist sales can help projects build hype and momentum leading up to the token launch while fostering a sense of exclusivity among participants.

> If you select "Whitelist," follow these steps to configure your Whitelist Timer (sec): Set the duration (in seconds) for which the presale will remain exclusive to whitelisted participants. After this timer expires, the sale can be set by project owner to Public if the hard cap has not been reached

#### [TIERED WHITELIST SALE](https://docs.rogerpad.finance/devleopers-corner/presale-models/tiered-whitelist) <a href="#tiered-whitelist-sale" id="tiered-whitelist-sale"></a>

Elevate your token sale experience with a Tiered Whitelist Sale, where participants enjoy tiered benefits based on their level of engagement. From early access to bonus tokens, each tier offers unique privileges, creating a sense of progression and excitement that drives community engagement.&#x20;

* In a Tiered Whitelist Sale, participants are categorized into different tiers based on predetermined criteria set by the project team. Each tier is assigned specific benefits or privileges, such as early access to the token sale, bonus tokens, or discounted prices. Tier 1 participants typically receive the highest level of benefits, followed by Tier 2, Tier 3, and so on, depending on the structure of the whitelist. Tiered whitelist sales are often used to incentivize early engagement and reward loyal community members with exclusive perks. By offering tiered benefits, projects can create a sense of progression and excitement leading up to the token sale, driving participation and community engagement.

> 1\.               Add WL Tier:\
> Use this feature to create multiple rounds of whitelist access. You can add as many tiers as needed, with each tier receiving a specific timeframe for participation.
>
> ***
>
> Understanding the Tier System:
>
> 1.
>    * Tier 1: The first set of wallets on the whitelist gets priority access to the presale. These participants can buy tokens during the Tier 1 timer period.
>    * Tier 2: Once the Tier 1 timer ends, Tier 2 participants gain access. Tier 1 wallets can still participate during this time, but the second round provides an opportunity for a new group of investors.
>    * Tier 3: Following the same logic, Tier 3 access opens after the Tier 2 timer expires. Tier 1 and Tier 2 wallets can also buy during this time.
>
> This system can continue for as many tiers as you want to set up, with each tier offering a timed window for participation.

### Transition to Public Sale:

If the hard cap is not met after all whitelist tier timers have expired, the sale can be automatically switched to Public mode by the project owner. This allows anyone to participate and ensures the sale can reach its funding goal.
