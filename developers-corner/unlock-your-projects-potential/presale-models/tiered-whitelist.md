* In a Tiered Whitelist Sale, participants are categorized into different tiers based on predetermined criteria set by the project team. Each tier is assigned specific benefits or privileges, such as early access to the token sale, bonus tokens, or discounted prices. Tier 1 participants typically receive the highest level of benefits, followed by Tier 2, Tier 3, and so on, depending on the structure of the whitelist. Tiered whitelist sales are often used to incentivize early engagement and reward loyal community members with exclusive perks. By offering tiered benefits, projects can create a sense of progression and excitement leading up to the token sale, driving participation and community engagement.

> Understanding the Tier System:

> 1.
>    * Tier 1: The first set of wallets on the whitelist gets priority access to the presale. These participants can buy tokens during the Tier 1 timer period.
>    * Tier 2: Once the Tier 1 timer ends, Tier 2 participants gain access. Tier 1 wallets can still participate during this time, but the second round provides an opportunity for a new group of investors.
>    * Tier 3: Following the same logic, Tier 3 access opens after the Tier 2 timer expires. Tier 1 and Tier 2 wallets can also buy during this time.
>
> This system can continue for as many tiers as you want to set up, with each tier offering a timed window for participation.

### Transition to Public Sale:

If the hard cap is not met after all whitelist tier timers have expired, the sale can be automatically switched to Public mode by the project owner. This allows anyone to participate and ensures the sale can reach its funding goal.
