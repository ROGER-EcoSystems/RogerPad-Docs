Presenting the Buyback Program, a meticulously structured initiative within token presales where developers strategically allocate funds for liquidity locking while earmarking a segment for scheduled token repurchases. This systematic approach involves repurchasing tokens at predetermined intervals, meticulously designed to stabilize the price chart and bolster investor confidence within the project's ecosystem.

The Buyback Program serves as a testament to the project's commitment to market stability and investor satisfaction. By offering flexibility in determining the buyback percentage, projects can seamlessly adapt to evolving market conditions, thereby fostering resilience and sustainability within the token ecosystem.

### Buyback and Burn Feature

The Buyback and Burn Feature is a strategic mechanism used in tokenomics to support token value and foster long-term sustainability for a project.

### What Does It Mean?

* Buyback: The project team uses a portion of the profits or treasury funds to repurchase tokens from the open market.
* Burn: The repurchased tokens are permanently removed from circulation by sending them to a burn address, reducing the total supply.

### Key Benefits:

1. **Supply Reduction:** Decreases token circulation, increasing scarcity and potential value.
2. **Price Support:** Buybacks create market buying pressure, helping stabilize or boost the token price.
3. **Holder Rewards:** Reducing supply benefits token holders by increasing the value of their holdings.
4. **Project Commitment:** Demonstrates the teamâ€™s dedication to sustaining token value and supporting the community.
5. &#x20;**Market Cap Optimization:** Allocates a portion of liquidity to execute buybacks and burns effectively.
6. **Jeet & Whale Protection:** A predetermined algorithm executes buybacks and burns, preventing manipulation by large investors or sellers.

### How It Works:

1. A percentage of raised funds is allocated to the Buyback and Burn program (e.g., 25% liquidity, 26% for buybacks).
2. This allocation is locked as part of pool creation and is irreversible after finalization.
3. Buybacks and burns occur automatically and are not publicly advertised.
4. &#x20;Aligned with deflationary tokenomics, this feature creates a robust ecosystem, enhances market stability, and drives long-term value for token holder

This feature aligns with deflationary tokenomics, creating a healthier ecosystem and fostering long-term value for token holders.
