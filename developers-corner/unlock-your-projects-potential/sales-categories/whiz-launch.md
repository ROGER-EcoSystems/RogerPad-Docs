# Whiz Launch

A Whiz Launch is similar to a Fair Launch but is limited by the number of contributors, as determined by the project owners. It has a Softcap but no Hardcap. You will need to specify the number of contributors who can participate in the sale. The sale either ends once all the spots are taken or when the sale timer runs out.

&#x20;You can set minimum and maximum contribution limits. At least 51% of the sale proceeds must be locked in liquidity. The sale can be configured as either Whitelisted, allowing only specified wallet addresses to participate, or Public, enabling anyone to buy in.

### Benefits:

Whiz Launch is a token sale model akin to Fair Launch but distinguished by predetermined contributor limits. It features a Softcap instead of a Hardcap and allows project owners to specify minimum and maximum contributions while locking liquidity (with a minimum of 51% of the sale). This structure ensures fairness, transparency, and liquidity stability while encouraging early engagement from contributors within set limits.

### Steps to Create a Whiz Launch:

1. Ensure your wallet holds at least the number of tokens required for the sale, as you will need to deposit them.
2. Set the Softcap for the sale.
3. Specify the number of contributors who can participate.
4. Establish the minimum and maximum contribution limits.
5. Decide whether the sale will be Whitelisted or Public.
