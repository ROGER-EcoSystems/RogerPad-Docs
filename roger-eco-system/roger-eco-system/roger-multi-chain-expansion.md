# ROGER Multi-Chain EXPANSION:

Prepare for our groundbreaking expansion onto other blockchain networks with the imminent launch of RogerPad's decentralized exchange (DEX). Seamlessly transition between multiple chains with unparalleled ease, as our DEX facilitates swift and secure exchanges across various blockchain ecosystems.

&#x20;Our expansion plan unfolds in two distinct phases, beginning with integration into the Solana Chain, followed by subsequent incorporation into Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Chains. This strategic approach ensures a gradual yet comprehensive expansion across prominent blockchain networks, including Ethereum (Eth), Binance Smart Chain (BSc), Polygon (Matic), Arbitrum, and Akash, among others. Roger token will be deployed on each chain separately, ensuring widespread accessibility and usability across all platforms.

As we embark on this ambitious expansion journey, we remain committed to our founding principles of inclusivity and fairness. Existing patrons from previous projects will seamlessly transition into our ecosystem, becoming integral members of our growing community. This commitment underscores our unwavering promise: no one loses with our system.

With each step forward, we reaffirm our dedication to pioneering interoperability and empowering users to navigate seamlessly across diverse blockchain networks. Join us as we redefine the landscape of decentralized finance and unlock boundless opportunities for all participants within our ecosystem.
