The Gold Rank signifies a significant advancement in safety and quality standards compared to the Silver Rank. Projects aiming for listing in the Gold Rank must meet stricter criteria, such as completing the KYC process or obtaining an audit. Notably, the Gold Rank is the sole tier accepting third-party KYC services, offering flexibility to project owners. RogerPad maintains the authority to remove projects from the Gold Rank due to safety concerns.
