The Silver Rank, also known as the Common Rank, serves as the entry point for projects on RogerPad. Projects listed in this rank have minimal prerequisites, allowing virtually anyone to create and publish their project on the platform. It's important to note that projects in the Silver Rank do not undergo KYC (Know Your Customer) or AUDIT verification, indicating a basic level of scrutiny. RogerPad retains the right to delist projects from the Silver Rank for safety concerns.

### **Pre-Requirements:**

* No KYC or AUDIT is required.
* Minimum of 2 SOL worth of $ROGER or 500,000 $ROGER Tokens (Whichever is lowest) in the wallet.
* Any contract can be deployed.
