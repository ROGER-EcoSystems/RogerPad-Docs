# Project Rankings

Roger LaunchPad introduces a tiered system comprising five tiers, each tailored to accommodate projects of varying degrees of sophistication and readiness. The tiers are structured on a scale, with the first tier designated as "common," followed by three additional tiers that offer progressively enhanced functionality and service. As projects ascend through the tiers, they benefit from heightened safety and improved service quality.

It's imperative to note that each tier is accompanied by specific requirements that project owners must satisfy during the application process. These requirements serve as benchmarks for assessing the suitability and preparedness of projects for launch on Roger LaunchPad.

Furthermore, Roger LaunchPad operates with a clear delineation of responsibilities. While it provides a platform for project launches, it does not assume responsibility for projects unless explicitly stated. Project owners are accountable for meeting the necessary criteria and adhering to regulatory standards.

Additionally, Roger LaunchPad emphasizes the importance of Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance. Projects seeking to launch on the platform must undergo KYC verification, ensuring transparency and regulatory compliance.

By implementing these measures, Roger LaunchPad aims to foster a secure and conducive environment for project launches while upholding standards of integrity and accountability.
