The Diamond Rank represents the pinnacle of excellence on RogerPad, exclusively for projects demonstrating exceptional quality, innovation, and potential. To qualify for the Diamond Rank, projects undergo rigorous scrutiny, including KYC validation, contract audits, and a unique vetting process exclusive to RogerPad. Private sales are ineligible for placement in the Diamond Rank due to associated heightened risks. RogerPad retains the right to decline projects from launching in the Diamond Rank to maintain platform standards.
