DOXX BADGE

This act of "doxxing" themselves is a transparency measure, allowing users and community members to know who is behind the project and have a clear understanding of the individuals involved. This can contribute to building trust within the community, as users may feel more confident investing or participating in a project when they know the identities of the people responsible for its development and management. The "DOXXED" badge, in this case, becomes a symbol of openness and accountability.
