### Buyback Program Summary

The Buyback Program is a strategic initiative in token presales that allows developers to allocate funds for liquidity locking and scheduled token repurchases. This approach is designed to:

* **Stabilize the price chart** and **boost investor confidence** by systematically repurchasing tokens at predetermined intervals.
* **Adapt to market conditions** with flexible buyback percentages, ensuring the project remains resilient and sustainable.
* **Enhance project appeal** by combining the Buyback & Burn program with liquidity pools (LP), allowing projects to meet minimum LP requirements while maintaining a low market cap, which attracts investors and generates hype.
* **Flexible setup options** allow developers to tailor the buyback process to their specific needs, creating a positive impact on the projectâ€™s overall success.
