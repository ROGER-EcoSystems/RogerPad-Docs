# USE CASES

#### Staking

Roger NFTs could be utilized in staking mechanisms where holders of Roger NFTs are rewarded with additional tokens or benefits for staking their NFTs. This could incentivize long-term holding and participation in the ecosystem.

&#x20;PreSale Whitelist

Holders of Roger NFTs could gain exclusive access to presale whitelists for future versions of the Roger platform or associated projects. This would provide early access and potentially discounted token prices for participating in presales.

#### &#x20;Discount of Launches (Devs)

Developers who hold Roger NFTs could be offered a discount when launching their projects on the Roger Pad platform. This incentivizes developers to engage with the platform and encourages the ecosystem's growth.

#### &#x20;Discount on Airdrop (Devs)

Similarly, developers who hold Roger NFTs could receive a discount when utilizing the AirDrop feature on the Roger platform. This feature allows projects to distribute tokens to a wide audience, and offering discounts to NFT holders incentivizes participation in AirDrop campaigns.

Roger NFT Benefits

In addition to the existing benefits provided to Roger NFT holders, we are introducing new revenue-sharing opportunities directly linked to Paws Combat. These benefits are designed to further enhance the value of holding a Roger NFT, while also supporting the overall PurrPaws ecosystem.

1. Buyback and Burn Mechanism:\
   To support the deflationary model of PurrPaws, 10% of all revenue generated from advertisements within the Paws Combat platform will be allocated towards the buyback and burn of $PPAWS tokens. This mechanism helps reduce the total token supply, adding value to the existing token holdings while creating a deflationary pressure that could drive long-term appreciation of the token.
2. Revenue Sharing for NFT Holders:\
   Roger NFT holders will also benefit from a 15% share of all advertising revenue generated through Paws Combat. This revenue will be distributed amongst NFT holders who meet the eligibility criteria. To qualify, holders must own a minimum of $500 worth of $PPAWS tokens and must have been a part of the whitelist buyers group. This revenue-sharing model will be combined with PurrPaws rewards, further incentivizing active participation and providing substantial value for both Roger NFT and $PPAWS holders.
