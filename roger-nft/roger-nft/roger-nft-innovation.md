# ROGER NFT Innovation:

The Roger ecosystem presently concentrates its efforts on the Solana chain, yet it aims to establish adaptability across numerous other blockchain networks. Following extensive research, we have opted to deploy our Roger NFT on the Polygon chain due to its convenience and cost-effectiveness for transactional activities. As the Roger launch pad on Solana achieves success, we plan to extend our reach to other EVM-compatible chains, including Polygon.

### Advantages:

1. The total supply of Roger NFTs is limited to 2000 across all supported chains, ensuring scarcity and value.
2. RogerPad will be launched across Eth, BSC, Polygon, Base and Solana Chain initially.
3. Our ecosystem won't be restricted solely to the Solana Chain, offering flexibility and resilience against network limitations.
4. Roger NFT holders can engage in trading activities using Matic (Polygon) on the widely recognized Opensea Marketplace, enhancing liquidity and market exposure.
5. The benefits and privileges conferred to Roger NFT holders remain consistent regardless of the blockchain network, ensuring equitable treatment and value retention.
6. Wide acceptance of our Roger NFTs across multiple chains fosters greater adoption and community participation.

&#x20;

### Disadvantages:

1. Acquisition of Roger NFTs necessitates the use of Matic (Polygon), potentially posing an initial barrier to entry for some users.
2. Utilizing a different blockchain network for trading may introduce inconvenience and unfamiliarity for certain users accustomed to Solana.

&#x20;

Overall, while the expansion to Polygon and other EVM-compatible chains presents certain challenges, the benefits of broader accessibility, liquidity, and community engagement outweigh these drawbacks, positioning the Roger ecosystem for sustained growth and success.
