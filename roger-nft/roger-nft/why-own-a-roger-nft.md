10. Roger NFT Benefits

    Added: October 7, 2024

    In addition to the existing benefits provided to Roger NFT holders, we are introducing new revenue-sharing opportunities directly linked to Paws Combat. These benefits are designed to further enhance the value of holding a Roger NFT, while also supporting the overall PurrPaws ecosystem.

    1. Buyback and Burn Mechanism:\
       To support the deflationary model of PurrPaws, 10% of all revenue generated from advertisements within the Paws Combat platform will be allocated towards the buyback and burn of $PPAWS tokens. This mechanism helps reduce the total token supply, adding value to the existing token holdings while creating a deflationary pressure that could drive long-term appreciation of the token.
    2. Revenue Sharing for NFT Holders:\
       Roger NFT holders will also benefit from a 15% share of all advertising revenue generated through Paws Combat. This revenue will be distributed amongst NFT holders who meet the eligibility criteria. To qualify, holders must own a minimum of $500 worth of $PPAWS tokens and must have been a part of the whitelist buyers group. This revenue-sharing model will be combined with PurrPaws rewards, further incentivizing active participation and providing substantial value for both Roger NFT and $PPAWS holders.
11. Additional Benefits: Further benefits and incentives will be unveiled in due course, enriching the value proposition for all stakeholders within the Roger ecosystem.
