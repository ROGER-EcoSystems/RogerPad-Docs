# Revoke Freeze

Revoking Freeze Authority is a crucial step in the process of creating a liquidity pool. Essentially, when you revoke freeze authority, you're effectively removing the ability to freeze the token on the holder's wallet. This action is essential for ensuring the fluidity and accessibility of the token within the liquidity pool. By revoking freeze authority, you enable holders to freely interact with and trade the token without any restrictions imposed by freezing mechanisms. This not only enhances the liquidity of the token but also fosters a more dynamic and vibrant ecosystem, ultimately benefiting both token holders and the overall project.
