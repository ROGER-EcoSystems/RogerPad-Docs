#### [CONVENTIONAL LAUNCH](https://docs.rogerpad.finance/v/rogerpad-solana-chain/solana-chain/solana-chain/roger-pad-details/type-of-sales/conventional-launch) <a href="#conventional-launch" id="conventional-launch"></a>

In a Regular Launch on RogerPad, projects follow the conventional path of initiating token sales with defined parameters and transparent processes. With this option, project owners can set clear timelines, establish token contracts, and straightforwardly execute sales, adhering to industry norms and best practices.

#### [DYNAMIC LAUNCH](https://docs.rogerpad.finance/v/rogerpad-solana-chain/solana-chain/solana-chain/roger-pad-details/type-of-sales/dynamic-launch) <a href="#dynamic-launch" id="dynamic-launch"></a>

Initiate a sale without specifying a date or token contract, allowing for flexibility in timing and token distribution.

#### [CUSTOM LAUNCH](https://docs.rogerpad.finance/v/rogerpad-solana-chain/solana-chain/solana-chain/roger-pad-details/type-of-sales/custom-launch) <a href="#custom-launch" id="custom-launch"></a>

Raise funds without a predefined token, enabling adaptability for projects in development or alternative fundraising approaches.
