> **Changed Your Mind? Here's How to Use the Emergency Withdrawal Feature!**
>
> We understand that circumstances can change, and flexibility is key. If youâ€™ve participated in a token presale but decided to withdraw your contribution, the **Emergency Withdrawal** feature is here to help. This option allows you to regain control of your funds while ensuring compliance with the presale protocol.
>
> Follow these easy yet professional steps to execute your emergency withdrawal smoothly:

1. Access Emergency Withdrawal: Navigate to the presale, fair launch, or subscription page where you initially made your contribution. Locate and click on the "Emergency Withdrawal" button.
2. Confirm Withdrawal: Upon selecting the emergency withdrawal option, a confirmation prompt will appear. Click "OK" to proceed with the emergency withdrawal process.
3. Confirm Transaction: After clicking "OK," MetaMask will prompt you to confirm the transaction. This prompt will display the associated penalty fee, which amounts to 10% of your original contribution. If you agree to the terms, click "Confirm" to initiate the transaction.

### Emergency Withdrawal Guidelines:

a)    Penalty Fee: Emergency withdrawals incur a 10% penalty fee, deducted from the withdrawn contribution. This action removes your contribution from the presale pool.

b)    Transaction Confirmation: After initiating the transaction, verify its success by checking your wallet balance. The withdrawn amount, minus the penalty fee, should be accurately reflected.

c)     Timing Restrictions: Emergency withdrawal is available until 60 minutes before the presale timer ends. However, if the hard cap is reached before the timer expires, the emergency withdrawal option remains accessible until the timer runs out.

d)    By adhering to these guidelines, participants can manage emergency withdrawals effectively while maintaining compliance with presale protocols.
