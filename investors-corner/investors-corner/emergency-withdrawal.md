# Emergency Withdrawal

> After participating in a token presale and subsequently deciding to withdraw your contribution, an option exists to utilize the "Emergency Withdrawal" feature. Here are the formal steps to execute an emergency withdrawal:

1. Access Emergency Withdrawal: Navigate to the presale, fair launch, or subscription page where you initially made your contribution. Locate and click on the "Emergency Withdrawal" button.
2. Confirm Withdrawal: Upon selecting the emergency withdrawal option, a confirmation prompt will appear. Click "OK" to proceed with the emergency withdrawal process.
3. Confirm Transaction: After clicking "OK," MetaMask will prompt you to confirm the transaction. This prompt will display the associated penalty fee, which amounts to 10% of your original contribution. If you agree to the terms, click "Confirm" to initiate the transaction.

Note:

a) Emergency withdrawals entail a 10% penalty fee applied to the withdrawn contribution. This action removes your contribution from the presale pool.

b) Transaction Verification: Once the transaction is confirmed, verify its successful completion by checking your wallet balance. The withdrawn contribution, minus the penalty fee, should be reflected in your wallet.

c) Timing Consideration: Keep in mind that emergency withdrawal is available until the **last 60 minutes** before the presale timer concludes. However, if the hard cap is reached before the timer expires, the emergency withdrawal option remains accessible until the timer runs out.

By following these formalized steps, participants can efficiently execute an emergency withdrawal from a presale, ensuring flexibility and adherence to protocol.
