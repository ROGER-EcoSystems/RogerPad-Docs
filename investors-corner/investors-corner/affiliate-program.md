## Claiming Your Reward: <a href="#claiming-your-reward" id="claiming-your-reward"></a>

1\. Wait for Finalization: Rewards can typically be claimed only after the sale or promotion has been finalized. This means that the sale period has ended, and all transactions have been processed.

2\. Visit the Sale Page Again: Return to the sale page where you refer your friends or contacts.

3\. Find the Referral Box Again: Scroll down the page until you locate the same box you used to find the referral link earlier. This box should be on the right-hand side of the page.

4\. Follow Instructions: Once you've found the box, follow any instructions provided to claim your referral rewards. This may involve entering your details or taking additional steps to verify your referrals.

By following these steps, you can find your referral code, share it with others, and claim your rewards once the sale has ended. Make sure to adhere to any specific instructions provided by the sales organizer to ensure a smooth referral process.
