### Step 2: Explore the Launchpad

1. Access the Presale List:\
   Navigate to the "Launchpads" section from the homepage and select "Presale List." Alternatively, use the direct link provided by the project developers.
2. Find Your Project:\
   Use the menu to locate your desired project. Only presales with a "Live" status are open for participation.
3. Review Details:\
   Carefully examine all information about the presale to understand the terms before making a purchase.

### Step 3: Purchase Tokens

1. Click "BUY (Token Name):\
   Locate the "BUY" button, typically found on the right mid-section of the presale page.
2. Check Wallet Configuration:\
   Ensure youâ€™re using the correct blockchain network and have sufficient native coins in your wallet for the transaction.
3. Enter Purchase Amount:\
   Input the desired contribution amount in the "Amount" section. The system will automatically calculate the corresponding token quantity.
4. Initiate Transaction:\
   Click the "Buy" button to start the purchase process.
5. Confirm Transaction:\
   Your wallet will display the transaction details, including any applicable fees. If everything is correct, click "Confirm" to proceed.
6. Verify Your Purchase:\
   Once the transaction is complete, check the "Amount" and "You Purchased" sections to confirm your tokens.

### Step 4: Prepare for Token Claiming

* Import Token Address:\
  Copy the token contract address from the presale section and import it into your wallet to track your holdings.
* Token Claiming:\
  Tokens will only be claimable after the project developer finalizes the liquidity pool. For updates on claiming, refer to the project details.
