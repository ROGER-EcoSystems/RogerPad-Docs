# Trending



In the pre-sale phase on the Roger Pad platform, badges play a pivotal role in influencing the trending score, which determines visibility and attractiveness to potential investors. Each badge, including Dox, KYC, Audit, and Safu, contributes to a multiplier applied to the trending score. Specifically:

1. **Dox Badge:** This badge signifies that participants have voluntarily disclosed personal information, enhancing trust and transparency within the community. Obtaining the Dox badge results in an increased multiplier applied to the trending score.
2. **KYC Badge:** Implementing Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures verifies the identity of participants, bolstering security and regulatory compliance. Achieving the KYC badge amplifies the multiplier applied to the trending score.
3. **Audit Badge:** A token sale with an audit badge has undergone thorough scrutiny and validation by auditing firms, ensuring the integrity and reliability of the project. Earning the audit badge elevates the multiplier applied to the trending score.
4. **Safu Badge:** The Safu badge signifies additional security measures implemented to safeguard participants' funds and assets. Attaining the Safu badge results in a heightened multiplier applied to the trending score.

During the token sale phase, badges continue to influence the trending score as multipliers, but other factors come into play. The trending score is now predominantly influenced by the volume of activity and the time remaining until the end of the sale. Tokens with higher trading volumes and less time remaining tend to trend more prominently on the platform, attracting attention from potential investors.

As the token sale approaches its conclusion, the trending score increases dynamically, reflecting the urgency and scarcity of remaining opportunities. Tokens nearing the end of the sale period are likely to experience heightened visibility and interest, further incentivizing participation from investors.

In summary, badges on the Roger Pad platform serve as critical indicators of trust, compliance, and security, influencing the trending score and visibility of token sales both before and during the sale period. Additionally, factors such as trading volume and remaining sale time dynamically impact the trending score, amplifying the attractiveness and urgency of participating in token sales.
