# Guiding Principles

Please note the stringent requirements to hold a ranking within the Roger Eco-System:

Merely holding the token or NFT does not automatically grant entry to the appropriate tier; approval from the Roger Team is required.

&#x20;&#x20;

1. &#x20;Holders must maintain the minimum number of tokens stipulated for each tier, in addition to possessing Roger NFTs.
2. Active support of Roger Projects and a minimum of 60% following of the ecosystem's social media channels are mandatory.
3. Holder ranking badges are bestowed after maintaining ownership of the token and NFT for a consecutive 3-month period.
4.  Complete selloffs followed by buybacks within a wallet's transaction history are not permissible.

    Transferring tokens from a sell wallet to create a new wallet for ranking purposes is prohibited.
5. Any form of unethical behavior or foul play will result in disqualification.
6. The Roger Eco System team reserves the right to deny applications for ranking based on the aforementioned criteria or other reasons deemed necessary.
7. Revenue shares are distributed monthly to wallet holders after maintaining the badge for 3 consecutive months, applicable only to Diamond and Alpha class members.
8. Different ranking rules apply to developers; please refer to the specific guidelines for DEV Ranking.

These requirements underscore the commitment to integrity, engagement, and support within the Roger community, ensuring that rankings are bestowed upon deserving individuals who actively contribute to the ecosystem's growth and success.
