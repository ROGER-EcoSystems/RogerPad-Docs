# ♨️ RANKINGS

## Rankings Introduction

Ranking for holders and developers is essential in ensuring a fair and thriving ecosystem within the RogerPad platform. There are four different Rankings Shiled can be achieved:

1. Diamond Ranking    [INV.](investor-ranking/diamond-ranking.md) | [DEV](dev-ranking/)
2. Platinum Ranking.   [INV.](investor-ranking/platinum-ranking.md) | [DEV](dev-ranking/)
3. Gold Ranking     [INV.](investor-ranking/diamond-ranking.md)[ ](investor-ranking/gold-ranking.md)| [DEV](dev-ranking/)

Here's how we approach ranking for both parties:

&#x20;Within the RogerPad ecosystem, both holders and developers adhere to a framework grounded in transparency, incentives, and performance evaluation. This framework is designed to uphold accountability and foster active participation, thereby contributing to the vibrancy of the ecosystem.

&#x20;For holders, engagement and contributions form the basis of evaluation. Their level of involvement and the impact of their contributions are carefully assessed to determine their standing within the ecosystem. Likewise, developers are subject to scrutiny based on the success and innovation demonstrated by their projects. These evaluations serve to incentivize excellence and drive continuous improvement within the ecosystem.

&#x20;It's essential to underscore that participation in the ranking system is optional for holders and mandatory solely for developers seeking to avail themselves of added benefits. Furthermore, developers are not compelled to obtain a ranking; it remains at their discretion.

&#x20;In essence, the ranking system serves as a mechanism to recognize and reward active participation and excellence within the RogerPad ecosystem, ultimately contributing to its ongoing growth and success.
