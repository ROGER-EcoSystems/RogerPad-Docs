# Guidelines for Ranking

Please note the stringent requirements to hold a ranking within the Roger Eco-System:

Merely holding the token or NFT does not automatically grant entry to the appropriate tier; approval from the Roger Team is required.

&#x20;

1. DEVs must maintain the minimum number of tokens stipulated for each tier, in addition to possessing Roger NFTs.
2. Any form of unethical behavior or foul play will result in disqualification.
3. The Roger Eco System team reserves the right to deny applications for ranking based on the aforementioned criteria or other reasons deemed necessary.
4. To qualify for RevShare, you must follow the rules for Holder Ranking.

&#x20;These requirements underscore the commitment to integrity, engagement, and support within the Roger community, ensuring that rankings are bestowed upon deserving individuals who actively contribute to the ecosystem's growth and success.

#### Please Note:

&#x20;To qualify for each ranking tier, you must hold Roger Tokens of the same ranking. This ensures the alignment of interests between project owners and token holders.

It is imperative to acknowledge that Roger LaunchPad reserves the right to decline project launches under any of these tiers.
