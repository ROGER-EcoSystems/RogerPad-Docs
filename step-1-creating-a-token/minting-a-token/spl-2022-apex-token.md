> An SPL Token-2022 refers to a specific type of token on the Solana blockchain with added functionality compared to standard SPL tokens. SPL stands for "Solana Program Library," which sets the framework for creating and managing tokens on the Solana blockchain. The SPL token is similar to Ethereum's ERC-20 token standard, but with unique features that align with Solana's design and ecosystem.
>
> ### What Makes SPL Token-2022 Unique?
>
> While SPL tokens generally represent fungible assets on Solana, SPL Token-2022 takes a step further by introducing "token extensions." These extensions offer additional features, with the most notable being the ability to incorporate transaction fees, also known as "Tax Tokens."
>
>
>
> ### Key Characteristics of SPL Token-2022
>
> * Transaction Fees: SPL Token-2022 can have built-in transaction fees. This feature allows token creators to set a fee for transactions involving the token, which is deducted from each transfer. This mechanism is sometimes used to support project funding or to incentivize specific behaviors within a community.
> * Standard Compatibility: SPL Token-2022 maintains compatibility with the standard SPL framework, meaning it can interact with other Solana-based projects and wallets without issues.
> * Additional Functions: These tokens may also include other features, such as governance rights, staking capabilities, or specialized use cases unique to the project that issues them.
>
>
>
> ### Benefits of the Transfer Tax
>
> * Project Funding: By collecting a small fee on each transfer, you can create a source of funding for ongoing project development or other costs.
> * Community Rewards: The collected fees can be redistributed to token holders or used for community incentives, encouraging engagement and loyalty.
> * Discouraging Speculation: A transfer tax can help reduce speculative trading by adding a cost to frequent transactions, promoting a more stable token ecosystem.
