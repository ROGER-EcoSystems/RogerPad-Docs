### Air Drop Instructions

Before proceeding, please ensure you have the following:

1\.      Connected OWNER Wallet: Connect the wallet that owns the tokens you wish to distribute. Ensure it has a sufficient balance of the native coin (e.g., ETH, BNB) to cover transaction fees.

2\.     Token Balance: Ensure the wallet holds enough of the project tokens to complete the distribution.

### Steps for Completing the Air Drop:

1\.      Enter the Token Address: Provide the contract address of the token you want to distribute.

2\.     Enter Recipient Wallet Addresses:

o   List all wallet addresses you want to send tokens to.

o   Enter each address on a new line or separate them with commas for clarity.

3\.     Specify the Amount:

o   The amount must be the same for each wallet address. Ensure the total amount matches the sum of all tokens to be distributed.
