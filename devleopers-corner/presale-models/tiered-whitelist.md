# Tiered Whitelist

In a Tiered Whitelist Sale, participants are categorized into different tiers based on predetermined criteria set by the project team. Each tier is assigned specific benefits or privileges, such as early access to the token sale, bonus tokens, or discounted prices. Tier 1 participants typically receive the highest level of benefits, followed by Tier 2, Tier 3, and so on, depending on the structure of the whitelist. Tiered whitelist sales are often used to incentivize early engagement and reward loyal community members with exclusive perks. By offering tiered benefits, projects can create a sense of progression and excitement leading up to the token sale, driving participation and community engagement.
