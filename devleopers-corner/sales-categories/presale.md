# PreSale

A presale is a sale type characterized by both a Softcap and a Hardcap. The success of the sale is contingent upon reaching the Softcap, which must be at least 25% of the Hardcap. Additionally, you must establish minimum and maximum contribution limits. The liquidity must be locked at a minimum of 51% of the sale proceeds. After the sale concludes, you will have access to a FINALIZE button to complete the process.

The presale can be configured as either Whitelisted, allowing only specified wallet addresses to participate, or Public, enabling anyone to buy in.
