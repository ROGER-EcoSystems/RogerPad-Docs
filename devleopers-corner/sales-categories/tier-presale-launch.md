# Tier PreSale Launch

A Tier PreSale Launch involves setting a Softcap and a Hardcap, with the sale being successful only if the Softcap is reached. You will also need to set minimum and maximum contribution limits and lock at least 51% of the sale proceeds in liquidity. After the sale concludes, you will have access to a FINALIZE button.

What sets a Tier PreSale Launch apart from a standard presale is the inclusion of linear stages. This means you can set it up so that early investors receive a better price than those who invest later.

The sale can be configured as either Whitelisted, allowing only specified wallet addresses to participate, or Public, enabling anyone to buy in.
