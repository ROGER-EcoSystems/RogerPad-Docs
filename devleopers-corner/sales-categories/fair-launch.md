# Fair Launch

A fair launch is a sale type characterized by having a Softcap but no Hardcap. The success of the sale is contingent upon reaching the Softcap. Additionally, you must establish minimum and maximum contribution limits. At least 51% of the sale proceeds must be locked in liquidity. After the sale concludes, you will have access to a FINALIZE button to complete the process.

&#x20;The fair launch can be configured as either Whitelisted, allowing only specified wallet addresses to participate, or Public, enabling anyone to buy in.
