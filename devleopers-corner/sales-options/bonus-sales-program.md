### Incentivizing Early Participation: Enhancing Token Distribution through the Bonus Sale Program

The Bonus Buy Feature is designed to enhance engagement and incentivize participation during a token presale or sale event. This feature allows project owners to reward buyers with additional tokens or exclusive perks based on their purchase amounts.

### Key Benefits:

1. Encourages Larger Purchases: Buyers are incentivized to purchase more tokens to receive bonus rewards.
2. Community Engagement: Creates excitement and motivates participants to compete for higher bonuses.
3. Customizable Tiers: Project owners can set specific thresholds for bonuses (e.g., purchases above 1 ETH get a 10% bonus).

### How It Works:

* Project owners define bonus tiers (e.g., percentage or fixed amount of extra tokens).
* Buyers automatically receive their bonuses based on their contribution amount.
* The system is transparent, ensuring fair distribution of rewards.

### Bonus Sales Program

The Bonus Sale program is a flexible and structured approach to token distribution, designed to incentivize early investor participation and strengthen community engagement. It offers additional tokens or exclusive benefits based on predefined criteria, using a tiered system that caters to varying levels of investor commitment. The program can be implemented in multiple phases, allowing developers to allocate specific percentages of tokens based on factors like purchase timing or investment amounts. This customizable approach enables projects to attract early investors, foster loyalty, and enhance their position in the competitive cryptocurrency market.

&#x20;This feature is an effective way to drive sales momentum and reward loyal supporters of your project!
