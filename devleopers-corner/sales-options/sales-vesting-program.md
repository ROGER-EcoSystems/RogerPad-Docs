Similarly, the Presale Vesting Program governs the distribution of tokens sold during the presale phase. Tokens purchased by early supporters and investors are subject to a vesting schedule, ensuring that they are released gradually over time. This not only encourages long-term participation but also safeguards against potential market volatility caused by a sudden influx of tokens. Moreover, it fosters a fair and transparent distribution process, enhancing trust and confidence among token holders.
