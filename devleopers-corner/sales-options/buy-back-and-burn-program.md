Presenting the Buyback Program, a meticulously structured initiative within token presales where developers strategically allocate funds for liquidity locking while earmarking a segment for scheduled token repurchases. This systematic approach involves repurchasing tokens at predetermined intervals, meticulously designed to stabilize the price chart and bolster investor confidence within the project's ecosystem.

The Buyback Program serves as a testament to the project's commitment to market stability and investor satisfaction. By offering flexibility in determining the buyback percentage, projects can seamlessly adapt to evolving market conditions, thereby fostering resilience and sustainability within the token ecosystem.
