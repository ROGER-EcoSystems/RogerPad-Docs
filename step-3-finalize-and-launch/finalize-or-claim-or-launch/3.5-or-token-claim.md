# 3.5 | Token Claim

The Project Developer can configure the method for investors to claim tokens purchased during the presale. Some developers prefer to implement a vesting schedule for presale purchases, gradually releasing tokens over a set period. Others may allow investors to claim their tokens immediately before the project launch. The approach taken depends on the specific strategy and goals of the project team. This flexibility allows project developers to tailor the token distribution process to best suit their project's needs and objectives.
