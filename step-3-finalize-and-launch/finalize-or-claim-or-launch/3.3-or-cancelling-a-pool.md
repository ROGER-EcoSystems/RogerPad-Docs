# 3.3 | Cancelling a Pool

A pool can be canceled by the Project Developer at any time before the deal is finalized, without needing to provide a reason. In such cases, all funds contributed by investors will be refunded. This cancellation process ensures that investors' money is securely returned if the project does not proceed as planned. The flexibility to cancel the pool prior to finalization provides a safeguard for both developers and investors, maintaining trust and financial security within the project.
