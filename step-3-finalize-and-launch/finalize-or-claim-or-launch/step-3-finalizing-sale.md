4. Find the "Finalize Sale" Button: Within the Owner section, you should see a button labeled "Finalize Sale." Click on this button to proceed with finalizing the sale.
5. Confirm the Transaction: After clicking on the "Finalize Sale" button, you may be prompted to confirm the transaction. Follow any on-screen prompts or instructions to complete the finalization process.
