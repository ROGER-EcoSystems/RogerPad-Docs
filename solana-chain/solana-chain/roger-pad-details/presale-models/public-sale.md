# Public Sale

In a Public Sale, also known as an Open Sale, tokens are available to a wide range of investors without restrictions. This type of sale allows anyone interested in the project to participate, providing equal opportunity for all to acquire tokens. Public sales are characterized by their inclusivity and accessibility, making them an attractive option for projects seeking broad exposure and widespread adoption. Additionally, the transparency of public sales fosters trust among investors, as everyone has the same chance to participate and contribute to the project's success.
