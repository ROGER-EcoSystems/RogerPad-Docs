# Min/Max Buy

The minimum and maximum buy refer to the smallest and largest amounts of tokens that an individual investor can purchase during a token sale or trading event.

In token sales, the minimum buy is typically set to ensure that all participants meet a certain threshold of investment, while the maximum buy serves to prevent any single investor from acquiring an excessively large portion of the available tokens, thereby promoting fair distribution and preventing market manipulation.

&#x20;

The minimum buy establishes a baseline investment requirement, ensuring that participants are committed to the project and preventing insignificant transactions that could inflate transaction costs or complicate token distribution logistics.

&#x20;

Conversely, the maximum buy restricts the amount of tokens that any single investor can purchase, safeguarding against the concentration of tokens in the hands of a few individuals. This measure helps maintain a diverse and decentralized distribution of tokens, reducing the risk of market manipulation and promoting a level playing field for all participants.

&#x20;

Setting appropriate minimum and maximum buy limits is crucial for ensuring a fair and transparent token sale process, fostering investor confidence, and promoting the long-term success and sustainability of the project.
