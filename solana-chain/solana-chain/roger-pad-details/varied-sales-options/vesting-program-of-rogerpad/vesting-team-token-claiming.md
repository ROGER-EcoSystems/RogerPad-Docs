To unlock vested tokens on Roger Guard's page, follow these steps:

1. Connect your wallet.
2. Visit Roger Guard's page or access it from the project's dashboard.
3. Look for the option to manage vested tokens or navigate to the appropriate section.
4. Locate the token lock associated with the vested tokens you wish to unlock.
5. Click on the “Unlock” button.
6. Review the details of the unlocking process, including any associated fees.
7. Confirm the transaction to proceed with unlocking the vested tokens.

By following these steps, project owners can unlock vested tokens at the end of each vesting cycle using RogerGuard, ensuring a seamless process for claiming their tokens.

Additionally, if project owners are unable to withdraw their vested tokens when a cycle expires, they can do so at any time afterward. If they wait until the next cycle expires, the total amount that can be withdrawn will be the balance of the previous cycle amount plus the number of tokens from the recently expired cycle. This process allows flexibility for project owners to manage their vested tokens according to their needs and circumstances.
