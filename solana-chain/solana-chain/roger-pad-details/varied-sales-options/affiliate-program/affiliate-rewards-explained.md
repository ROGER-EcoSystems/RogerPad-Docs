Affiliate Rewards Explained

\
In the given example, let's break down how the referral rewards were calculated:

1. Total Raise: The project raised 100 SOL.
2. Referral Reward Percentage: The project allocated 5% of the raise for referral rewards, which amounts to a total reward pool of 5 SOL.
3. Total Referred Buys: The total worth of buys referred was 20 SOL.

&#x20;

Now, to calculate the actual total reward, we use the formula: Total Reward=Total Referred Buys × Referral Reward Percentage Total Reward=Total Referred Buys × Referral Reward Percentage

&#x20;

Substituting the values: Total Reward=20 SOL×5%=1&#x20;

So, the total reward pool is 1 SOL.

&#x20;

Next, we allocate the rewards among the referrers based on their contribution:

* Referrer X referred friends who bought 10 SOL.
* Referrer Y referred friends who bought 6 SOL.
* Referrer Z referred friends who bought 4 SOL.
* &#x20;

We calculate each referrer's share of the reward pool:

* Referrer X: (10 SOL/20 SOL×1 SOL)=0.5 SOL (50% of the reward pool)
* Referrer Y:  (6 SOL/20 SOL×1 SOL)=0.3 SOL (30% of the reward pool)
* Referrer Z:  (4 SOL/20 SOL×1 SOL)=0.2 SOL (20% of the reward pool)

So, each referrer received the following rewards:

* Referrer X: 0.5 SOL
* Referrer Y: 0.3 SOL
* Referrer Z: 0.2 SOL

This allocation ensures that the rewards are distributed proportionally based on the amount referred by each referrer.
