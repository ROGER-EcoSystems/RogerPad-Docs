# Whiz Launch

Whiz Launch is a token sale model akin to Fair Launch but distinguished by predetermined contributor limits. It features a Softcap instead of a Hardcap and allows project owners to specify minimum and maximum contributions while locking liquidity (with a minimum of 51% of the sale). This structure ensures fairness, transparency, and liquidity stability while encouraging early engagement from contributors within set limits.
