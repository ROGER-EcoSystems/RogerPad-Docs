# Presale

A presale on RogerPad offers project owners the opportunity to launch their tokens with precision and efficiency. With a defined Softcap and Hardcap, this sale type ensures that projects can secure the necessary funding for development and growth while providing investors with clear goals and expectations. Liquidity locking adds an additional layer of security, safeguarding investor funds and enhancing trust in the project. By setting minimum and maximum contribution limits, project owners can manage investor participation and ensure a fair and balanced distribution of tokens. With the presale's success contingent on reaching the Softcap, both project owners and investors are incentivized to work together towards achieving mutual success.
