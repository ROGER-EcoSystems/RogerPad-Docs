# Identifying the Need for ROGER PAD

In the Solana ecosystem, the absence of launchpads with user-friendly interfaces and support for taxable contracts poses significant challenges for project management and fundraising. Without proper management and sufficient funds, even promising projects may struggle to succeed. The lack of taxation within smart contracts allows traders to freely buy and sell tokens without fees, undermining project sustainability and revenue generation. This issue is particularly critical in the Solana chain, where transaction fees are already minimal, exacerbating the challenge of funding essential activities like marketing and development. Addressing these challenges is essential for creating a thriving and sustainable environment for project development and investment on Solana.
