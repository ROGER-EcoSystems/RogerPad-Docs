# Transfer Lock Ownership

LINK:



{% hint style="warning" %}
Certain situations may necessitate the transfer of your lock to another wallet address of your choosing. This feature is specifically designed for cases where the original wallet owner seeks to maintain the integrity of the lock while ensuring ownership is securely transferred. It's imperative to note that only the original wallet owner can initiate this transfer process, ensuring the continuity of the lock parameters established from the outset.

&#x20;

In circumstances where there are concerns regarding the security of the wallet or suspicions of compromise, this transfer capability offers a proactive solution. Additionally, it facilitates seamless changes in ownership, allowing for smooth transitions when required.
