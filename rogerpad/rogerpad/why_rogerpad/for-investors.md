At RogerPad, we are dedicated to establishing a secure and reliable environment for investors. Our stringent measures uphold the highest standards of safety and assurance:



1.  **Rigorous Project Vetting**

    **Smart Contract Audits:** Thorough audits by leading security firms ensure the integrity and security of projects.

    **KYC and Doxxing:** Developers undergo stringent KYC verification and doxxing through trusted providers, ensuring transparency and accountability
2.  **Continuous Monitoring**

    **Security Assessments:** Ongoing security assessments and penetration testing identify and mitigate risks.

    **Regular Audits:** Frequent safety audits and inspections maintain compliance and project reliability.
3.  **Transparent Processes**

    **Detailed SOPs:** Clear procedures for all project stages ensure transparency and minimize risks.

    **Verified Communication Channels:** Secure and verified channels prevent fraud and phishing attacks.
4.  **Support and Communication**

    **24/7 Live Support:** Round-the-clock assistance for any issues enhances reliability and investor confidence. \[link]

    **Incident Reporting:** A robust incident reporting system ensures prompt resolution of safety incidents. \[link]
5.  **Automatic Liquidity Provision Requirements**

    **Mandatory Liquidity Creation:** Projects must implement automatic liquidity creation from raised funds, excluding private raises and seed phase raises.

    **Minimum LP Creation:** Liquidity provision should constitute at least 51% of the raise; projects may combine this with a back-and-burn system. \[link]
6.  **Investor Assurance**

    **Liquidity Locks:** Liquidity is locked for 14 days to prevent rug pulls and protect investor interests.

    **21-Day Limit:** Projects must finalize successful pools within 21 days of completion; otherwise, RogerPad cancels the pool and returns investor contributions without fees.

    **Emergency Withdrawal:** Investors can withdraw their investments up to 1 hour before the pool ends, with minimal fees. \[link]

    **No Fees on Cancelled Pools:** At RogerPad, investors are not charged any fees for pools that are canceled by the project developer or RogerPad. This policy ensures transparency and protects investor interests in uncertain situations.

> By implementing these measures, RogerPad provides investors with a secure and reliable platform to confidently support innovative projects.
