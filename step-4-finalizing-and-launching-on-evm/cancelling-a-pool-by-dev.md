# CANCELLING A POOL BY DEV

A project owner can cancel the presale pool under the following circumstances:

1. If the Soft Cap is met, but changes in the team, project vision, or other unforeseen circumstances arise.
2. For any other reasonable and valid reasons.

In all these cases, investors are entitled to withdraw their funds once the pool is canceled. Refer to the document for instructions on how to withdraw funds.

#### Important Notes:

* Soft Cap Not Met: If a project does not meet the Soft Cap, it will be automatically canceled by RogerPad.
* Hard Cap Met: If a project meets the Hard Cap, the project owner has 21 days to finalize and launch the project. If not launched within 21 days, RogerPad will cancel the project unless there are valid reasons to extend the launch period. This provides added protection for investors.
* Trust Is Key: At RogerPad, we prioritize trust as the most important aspect of a crypto launchpad.
