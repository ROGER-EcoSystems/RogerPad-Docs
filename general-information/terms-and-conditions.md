# Terms and Conditions

### Introduction to RogerPad and Decentralization

RogerPad is a cutting-edge decentralized launchpad, operating without centralized control or intermediaries. In this ecosystem, decision-making and authority are distributed among network participants, fostering greater transparency and autonomy. However, this decentralization places the onus of success or failure on project owners and participants.

All transactions on RogerPad are executed through smart contracts—self-executing agreements coded with predefined conditions. Once deployed, these contracts operate automatically, ensuring accuracy and eliminating human intervention in execution.

### Token Purchases

Token transactions on RogerPad are fully decentralized and governed by smart contracts.

* Purchases can only be completed via the RogerPad interface during an active presale.

***

### Token Distribution

After a successful presale, tokens will be distributed via RogerPad to the wallet used during the transaction.

* In some cases, alternative distribution methods (e.g., airdrops or third-party claims) may be used.
* Users must carefully review the specific distribution process of each project.
