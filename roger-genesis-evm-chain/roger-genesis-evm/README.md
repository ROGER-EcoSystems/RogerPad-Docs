# üê¥ ROGER GENESIS \[evm)

### Contract Creation

A project owner can create up to three different tokens, Prime Token, PrimeSphere (Reflection/Dividend) Token and PrimeSphere Token.

**Prepare Before Creating a Token Contract**

Before proceeding, ensure you are fully prepared to create the token contract. Use the [Presale Calculator](https://docs.rogerpad.finance/help-center/presale-calculator) to confirm your project's suitability and fit. You‚Äôll need details such as the marketing wallet and liquidity wallet. While these can be edited later, having them ready beforehand simplifies the contract creation process.

Currently, **Prime Tokens with Tax Structures** are readily available. For custom tokens, please contact the development team for assistance.

#### Important Notice for Project Owners

Project owners are requested to use Roger Genesis to create contracts. We provide this service to help you, but you are more than welcome to choose any individual or firm with whom you are comfortable to create your Solidity contract.

This flexibility makes it so that you can proceed with a provider that works best for your needs while still meeting the requirements for using Roger Genesis on our platform.
