# PrimeSphere Token  (R/D) \[EVM]

#### Reflection Token

The Reflection Token, similar to the Prime Token, introduces added utility for token holders. This model incentivizes holding by redistributing a portion of the buy and sell tax back to the holders. The distribution is proportional to the number of tokens held, meaning the more tokens a holder possesses, the greater the reflections they receive. This mechanism not only encourages long-term holding but also fosters a more engaged and committed community.

Key Features:

* Incentive Structure: A portion of every transaction (buy/sell) is redistributed to token holders.
* Proportional Distribution: Reflections are allocated based on the number of tokens held.
* Community Engagement: Encourages holders to maintain their positions, promoting stability and reducing volatility.

#### Dividend Token

The Dividend Token expands on the concept of the Reflection Token by offering flexibility in reward types. While it operates similarly by redistributing transaction taxes, the Dividend Token allows project owners to decide the form of the rewards. These rewards can be in various cryptocurrencies, such as ETH, DOGE, BNB, BUSD, BTC, or any other token chosen by the project owner. This adaptability enables projects to tailor rewards to their community's preferences, enhancing satisfaction and loyalty.

Key Features:

* Flexible Rewards: Project owners can choose the reward type from a wide range of cryptocurrencies.
* Incentive for Holding: Similar to the Reflection Token, dividends encourage long-term holding by providing regular rewards.
* Customization: Allows projects to align rewards with their strategic goals and community expectations.

PrimeSphere R/D exemplifies RogerPadâ€™s commitment to innovation and flexibility, providing project owners with powerful tools to engage their communities and drive long-term success. By offering both Reflection and Dividend Tokens, RogerPad ensures that every project can find the perfect fit for its unique needs.
